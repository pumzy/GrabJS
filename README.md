# GrabJS

GrabJS is an extremely lightweight JavaScript DOM interaction  Library, inspired by JQuery. Using GrabJS users can:
* Traverse and manipulate DOM elements
* Select single or multiple DOM elements, based upon a users input parameters
* Handle DOM events
* Send AJAX requests

At the core of this library is user-friendliness, with GrabJS's extremely intuitive syntax allowing its users to gain mastery of the DOM within a matter of seconds.

## Getting started

In order to use GrabJS, download this library into your project and add --grabjs.js-- in a script tag on the head of your root HTML page. An example of this is below:

--
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script src="./grabjs.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</head>
--

If you have installed GrabJS successfully, the following text will appear when you open up the console:

-- Thank you for using GrabJS --
